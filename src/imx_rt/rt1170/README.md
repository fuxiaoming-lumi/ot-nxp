# OpenThread on NXP RT1170 (host) + transceiver (rcp) example

This directory contains example platform drivers for the [NXP RT1170][rt1170] platform.

The example platform drivers are intended to present the minimal code necessary to support OpenThread. As a result, the example platform drivers do not necessarily highlight the platform's full capabilities.

## Configuration(s) supported

Here are listed configurations that allow to support Openthread on RT1170:

- RT1170 + IWX12

## Prerequisites

Before you start building the examples, you must download and install the toolchain and the tools required for flashing and debugging.

## Toolchain

OpenThread environment is suited to be run on a Linux-based OS.

In a Bash terminal (found, for example, in Ubuntu OS), follow these instructions to install the GNU toolchain and other dependencies.

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-nxp>
$ ./script/bootstrap
```

## Tools

- Download and install the [MCUXpresso IDE][mcuxpresso ide].

[mcuxpresso ide]: https://www.nxp.com/support/developer-resources/software-development-tools/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE

- Download [the SDK from the link.](https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/). Creating an nxp.com account is required before being able to download the SDK. S Select the **MIMXRT1170-EVKB** board. Select the SDK version 2.13.2.
  In the SDK Builder UI selection you should select at least
  the **FreeRTOS component**, the **BT/BLE component** and the **ARM GCC Toolchain**.

## Building examples

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-nxp>
$ export NXP_RT1170_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/previously/downloaded/SDK
$ ./script/build_rt1170
```

After a successful build, the ot-cli-rt1170 FreeRTOS version could be found in `build_rt1170` and include FTD (Full Thread Device).

Note: FreeRTOS is required to be able to build the IMXRT1170 platform files. By default, if no argument is given when running the script `build_rt1170`, a freertos ot cli will be created to support the following configurations:

- RT1170 + IWX12 with spinel over SPI (binaries located in `build_rt1170/iwx12_spi`)

### Hardware rework for SPI support on EVKB-MIMXRT1170

To support SPI on the EVKB-MIMXRT1170 board, it is required to remove 0Ω resistors R404,R406.

### Hardware rework to connect SPI on 2EL M2 IW612 Module

- Solder burg wires (male to female) at JP1 for SPI interface.

## Flash Binaries

### Flashing the IWX12 transceiver firmware

At each boot the RT1170 will automatically download the IWX12 firmware on the board via SDIO.

### Flashing the IMXRT ot-cli-rt1170 host image using MCUXpresso IDE

In order to flash the application for debugging we recommend using [MCUXpresso IDE (version >= 11.3.1)](https://www.nxp.com/design/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE?tab=Design_Tools_Tab).

- Import the previously downloaded NXP SDK into MCUXpresso IDE. This can be done by drag-and-dropping the SDK archive into MCUXpresso IDE.
- Follow the same procedure as described in [OpenThread on RT1060 examples][rt1060-page] in section "Flashing the IMXRT ot-cli-rt1060 host image using MCUXpresso IDE". Instead of selecting the RT1060 MCU, the RT1170 MCU should be chosen.

[rt1060-page]: ../rt1060/README.md

## Running the example

1. The CLI example uses UART connection. To view raw UART output, start a terminal emulator like PuTTY and connect to the used COM port with the following UART settings (on the IMXRT1170):

   - Baud rate: 115200
   - 8 data bits
   - 1 stop bit
   - No parity
   - No flow control

2. Follow the process describe in [Interact with the OT CLI][validate_port].

For a list of all available commands, visit [OpenThread CLI Reference README.md][cli].

## Known issues

- Factory reset issue when the board is attacted to MCUXpresso debugguer: before running the factory reset command the debugguer needs to be detached.
