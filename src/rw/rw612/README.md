# OpenThread on NXP RW612 Example

This directory contains example platform drivers for the [NXP RW612] based on [RD-RW612-BGA] hardware platform, including all variants of devices.
The example platform drivers are intended to present the minimal code necessary to support OpenThread. As a result, the example platform drivers do not necessarily highlight the platform's full capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you start building the examples, you must download and install the toolchain and the tools required for flashing and debugging.

## Toolchain

OpenThread environment is suited to be run on a Linux-based OS (Ubuntu OS for example), WSL (Ubuntu 20.04 on Windows) or Windows (command line).
There are three tools that need to be installed:

- CMake
- ninja
- the arm-non-eabi gcc cross-compiler

Depending on system used installing each tool done differently.

### Linux-based

In a Bash terminal (found, for example, in Ubuntu OS), follow these instructions to install the GNU toolchain and other dependencies.

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-nxp>
$ ./script/bootstrap
```

### WSL (Ubuntu 20.05 on Windows)

Open the WSL console and type the following.

```bash
$ sudo apt install ninja-build cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

### Windows

On this platform you have to install all the tools by downloading the installers:

- For the CMake get the downloader from the [official site](https://cmake.org) and install it
- For the ninja build system download the binary from the [official site](https://ninja-build.org). Place it in a path accessible from the windows command window.
- For the gcc-arm-non-eabi cross-compiler, download the installer from the [official site](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm) and install it

Make sure that the paths of all these tools are set into the `Path` system variable.

## Downloading the SDK

Download [the latest SDK from the link.](https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/). Creating an nxp.com account is required before being able to download the SDK. Select the RD-RW612-BGA (RW612) board. The SDK Builder UI selection should be similar with the one from the image below.

Click on "Build MCUXpresso SDK" button. On the next page select the desired Host OS and ALL for Toolchain/IDE. Additionaly `SELECT ALL` components and then press `DOWNLOAD SDK` button.
Once the SDK zip archive is downloaded, unzip it, and access the contents.

> **_NOTE:_** When using the SDK version 2.13.2 to build and run the OpenThread RW612 OTBR examples the LWIP component must be downloaded from the [LWIP NXP GitHub](https://github.com/nxp-mcuxpresso/lwip/tree/mcux_release_2.13.3_rw610_rfp2). Take the latest commit from the indicated branch and copy to SDK location `.../middleware/lwip` . The lwip folder in `.../middleware/` must be completely overwritten by the contents downloaded from GitHub.

## Building the examples

### Linux-like environment

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-nxp>
$ export NXP_RW612_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/previously/downloaded/SDK
$ ./script/build_rw612
```

To build for a specific device revision such as A0:

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-nxp>
$ export NXP_RW612_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/previously/downloaded/SDK
$ ./script/build_rw612 -DOT_NXP_DEVICE_REVISION=A0
```

### Windows

```bash
$ cd <path-to-ot-nxp>
$ set NXP_RW612_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/previously/downloaded/SDK
$ script\build-rw612.bat
```

After a successful build, the `elf` and `binary` files are found in `build_rw612/bin`:

- ot-cli-rw612 (the elf image)
- ot-cli-rw612.bin (the binary)

- ot-br-rw612 (the elf image)
- ot-br-rw612.bin (the binary)

For border router features see dedicated [README][otbr-readme-page] file.

[otbr-readme-page]:../../../examples/br/README-OTBR.md

## Flash Binaries

To flash the binaries we use the JLink from Segger. You can download it and install it from https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link.
Once it is install to flash the images run JLink from the command line (either windows or linux):

```bash
$ JLink
```

You will be presented with a menu like:

![JLink Prompt](../../../doc/img/rw612/jlink-prompt.jpg)

Run the following commands:

```bash
J-Link> connect
Device> ? # you will be presented with a dialog -> select `CORTEX-M33`
Please specify target interface:
 J) JTAG (Default)
 S) SWD
 T) cJTAG
TIF> S
Specify target interface speed [kHz]. <Default>: 4000 kHz
Speed> # <enter>
```

If successfull you will see the following screen:

![JLink Connection](../../../doc/img/rw612/jlink-connection.jpg)

At this point flush the image with the following command

```bash
J-Link> loadbin path/to/binary,0x08000000
```

## Running the example

1. Prepare two boards with the flashed `CLI Example` (as shown above).
2. The CLI example uses UART connection. To view raw UART output, start a terminal emulator like PuTTY and connect to the used COM port with the following UART settings:

   - Baud rate: 115200
   - 8 data bits
   - 1 stop bit
   - No parity
   - No flow control

3. Open a terminal connection on the first board and start a new Thread network. 

   Note that setting channel, panid, and network key is not enough anymore because of an Open Thread stack update.

   We first need to initialize a new dataset. Using `dataset` command we visualize the newly generated dataset.

```bash
> dataset init new
Done
> dataset
Active Timestamp: 1
Channel: 25
Channel Mask: 0x07fff800
Ext PAN ID: 42af793f623aab54
Mesh Local Prefix: fd6e:c358:7078:5a8d::/64
Network Key: f824658f79d8ca033fbb85ecc3ca91cc
Network Name: OpenThread-b870
PAN ID: 0xb870
PSKc: f438a194a5e968cc43cc4b3a6f560ca4
Security Policy: 672 onrc 0
Done
>
```
To change network parameters use:

```bash
> dataset panid 0xabcd
Done
> dataset channel 25
Done
```
Then commit the new dataset:

```bash
> dataset commit active
Done
> ifconfig up
Done
> thread start
Done
```

4. After a couple of seconds the node will become a Leader of the network.

```bash
> state
Leader
> dataset active -x
0e08000000000001000035060004001fffe0020842af793f623aab540708fd6ec35870785a8d0510f824658f79d8ca033fbb85ecc3ca91cc030f4f70656e5468726561642d623837300102b8700410f438a194a5e968cc43cc4b3a6f560ca40c0402a0f7f8000300000b
Done
>
```

5. Open a terminal connection on the second board and attach a node to the network.

```bash
> dataset set active 0e08000000000001000035060004001fffe0020842af793f623aab540708fd6ec35870785a8d0510f824658f79d8ca033fbb85ecc3ca91cc030f4f70656e5468726561642d623837300102b8700410f438a194a5e968cc43cc4b3a6f560ca40c0402a0f7f8000300000b
Done
> ifconfig up
Done
> thread start
Done
```

6. After a couple of seconds the second node will attach and become a Child.

```bash
> state
Child
```

7. List all IPv6 addresses of the first board.

```bash
> ipaddr
fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:fc00
fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:9c00
fdde:ad00:beef:0:4bcb:73a5:7c28:318e
fe80:0:0:0:5c91:c61:b67c:271c
```

8. Choose one of them and send an ICMPv6 ping from the second board.

```bash
> ping fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:fc00
16 bytes from fdde:ad00:beef:0:0:ff:fe00:fc00: icmp_seq=1 hlim=64 time=8ms
```
